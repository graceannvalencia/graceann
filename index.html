<h1>Birds of a Feather</h1>
<p>Billie Eilish.<p/>

<p>I want you to stay<br>
'Til I'm in the grave<br>
'Til I rot away, dead and buried<br>
'Til I'm in the casket you carry<br>
If you go, I'm going too, uh<br>
'Cause it was always you, alright<br>
And if I'm turning blue, please don't save me<br>
Nothing left to lose without my baby<br>
</p>

<p>Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know<br>
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone<br>
Can't change the weather, might not be forever<br>
But if it's forever, it's even better<br>
And I don't know what I'm crying for<br>
I don't think I could love you more<br>
It might not be long, but baby, I<br>
</p>

<p>I'll love you 'til the day that I die<br>
'Til the day that I die<br>
'Til the light leaves my eyes<br>
'Til the day that I die<br>
I want you to see, hm<br>
How you look to me, hm<br>
You wouldn't believe if I told ya<br>
You would keep the compliments I throw ya<br>
</p>

<p>But you're so full of shit, uh<br>
Tell me it's a bit, oh<br>
Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted<br>
Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid<br>
And I don't know what I'm crying for<br>
I don't think I could love you more<br>
Might not be long, but baby, I<br>
Don't wanna say goodbye<br>
</p>

<p>Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know ('til the day that I die)<br>
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone ('til the light leaves my eyes)<br>
Can't change the weather, might not be forever ('til the day that I die)<br>
But if it's forever, it's even better<br>
I knew you in another life<br>
You had that same look in your eyes<br>
I love you, don't act so surprised<br>
